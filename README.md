# Twitter Analytics

*See it in action:* http://raven-twitter.herokuapp.com/

This is a twitter analytics web app that I created. It uses basic sentiment analysis
by analysing the words in a tweet and comparing them against a giant list of positive and
negative words.

Note: The sentiment analysis techniques used are incredibly basic and will not give a true
representation of what people's opinions are

## What I learnt
 - Using NLTK to process qualitative data
 - Using a simple 'bag of words' model for sentiment analysis
 - Using the Twitter API to gather data quickly

## Features
* Accounting for double negatives
* Visually pleasing CSS and JS transitions
* Very professional looking
