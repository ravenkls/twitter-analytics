# Twitter Analytics

This is a twitter analytics web app that I created. It uses basic sentiment analysis
by analysing the words in a tweet and comparing them against a giant list of positive and
negative words.

Note: The sentiment analysis techniques used are incredibly basic and will not give a true
representation of what people's opinions are

## Features
* Accounting for double negatives
* Visually pleasing CSS and JS transitions
* Very professional looking
